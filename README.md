# Welcome to my Github!

Please make yourselves at home and take a look around if you're curious. Most of this is just abandoned experiments, so don't take it too seriously, but I'm sure there's some good code buried in here somewhere...

## About me

I really like making things with computers, especially anything music-adjacent. My day job revolves around web development, but I fiddle around with much more than that! Lately I have been working on building guitar pedals and teaching myself PCB design as well as embedded Rust (look for that over [here](https://github.com/heuristic-industries)).
